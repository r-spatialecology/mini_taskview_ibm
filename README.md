# Taskview Individual-Based Models

This is a collection of agent-based (or individual-based) models in R. It includes packages, codes, and tutorials dealing with the simulation of any kidn of agents in a spatially explicit landscape as well as in a non-spatial way. 

Contributions are welcome! Please submit an issue, or make a contribution. 

## Packages
- [nlrx](https://github.com/nldoc/nlrx): The nlrx package provides tools to setup NetLogo simulations in R. It uses a similar structure as NetLogos Behavior Space but offers more flexibility and additional tools for running sensitivity analyses.
- [SpaDES](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES) : Metapackage for implementing a variety of event-based models, with a focus on spatially explicit models. These include raster-based, event-based, and agent-based models.
- [simecol](http://simecol.r-forge.r-project.org/): "a lightweight R package that employs an object oriented paradigm for the implementation of dynamic simulation models."
- [NetLogoR](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR): "Easily create agent-based models in R following the NetLogo framework (Wilensky, 1999)."
- [BacArena](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BacArena/): "An Agent-Based Modeling Framework for Cellular Communities."
- [rtsetse](https://github.com/AndySouth/rtsetse): "R package for simulating tsetse fly populations to investigate control options."
